# Online-Bidding

- Nowadays, human bidders are frustrated with their inability to win auctions due to unfair interference of software-controlled robots in the bidding action.
- In this project, we tried to develop various classifiers to detect suspicious bot activity for a fictional online auction site.
- The main goal here was to identify whether the online auction bids are placed by ’human’ or a ‘robot’.

Implemented an Online bidding classification system to determine whether the bids are placed by human or robots, using linear regression, logistic regression, SVM, decision trees.
